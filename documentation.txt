In order to use our project, one must follow these steps:
(1) download the files in the zipped folder to your computer, and unzip it
(2) open a new terminal and change the directory to the folder that youâ€™ve unzipped
(3) run the command rails server on the command line*
(4) once you see that the command has gone through without error and you see port =
3000 (or potentially some other port, although for the purposes of this user manual we
will assume 3000) in the command line, open a new window or tab in your web browser
and type http://localhost:3000 into the addressable. You should see the home/index
page of our website show up.
(5) Explore the different links on the home page, and experiment with posting,
commenting, rating, and/or trying the random and adventurous features.
